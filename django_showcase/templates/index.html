<p>Welcome to our custom Django tutorial. This is made to supplement the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"> main Django tutorial</a> and provide both a more realistic and customized introduction to Django. It is a pretty rare occasion that you will <em>start</em> a Django project. Most of the time, you will start working on a project that already exists. This site aims to provide both a "showcase" and a "sandbox" for you to look around, play with, and learn. There will be specific instructions along the way to guide you, and all of the code should be commented nicely!</p>
